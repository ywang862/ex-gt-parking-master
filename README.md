# ex-gt-parking
There is a command line UI and some basic framework here.

In the first lecture, we created the NoSuchItemException. It is thrown whenever the user enters a Permit or Lot that does not exist in the parking system. The UI code catches this exception and displays an appropriate message to the user, and then returns to the main menu.

We'll finish the core functionality in class. (The complete code will be posted after class.)
